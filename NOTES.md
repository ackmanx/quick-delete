# Basic Functionality

* Auto load Camera Uploads folder in Dropbox

* Flag a photo using keyboard key x to mark delete
    * X photos are obvious that they were rejected

* Flag a photo using keyboard key k to mark keep
    * K photos are obvious that they're being kept

* Have action bar at bottom that's transparent with flag options

* When removing marked images, make sure there's no way to mark an image (like via index?) and then cause the file list to refresh. This would cause the indexes to change and wrong files get deleted. Maybe just mark the filename.
